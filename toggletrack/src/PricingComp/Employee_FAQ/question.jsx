        question:"How is the subscription fee calculated for paid plans?",
        answer: "You will be charged a monthly fee for each member of your team. For paid plans, this fee applies even if you have under 5 active users. You will not be charged for deactivated users. If you deactivate a user, all data associated with the deactivated user will be retained."

        question:"You mentioned that Toggl Track is free for up to 5 users. If I’m on a paid plan, do I only need to pay for the 6th user?" ,
        answer: "Yes, we’re on desktop and mobile. We have desktop apps for Windows and macOS, and mobile apps for iOS and Android. All of our apps are free to download and use."

        question:"Does Toggl Track track GPS and take screenshots?" ,
        answer: "Toggl Track stands against employee surveillance and micromanagement. Monitoring has never been a feature in our software nor our culture—and it never will be. Toggl Track is not for managers who are trying to snoop. We will never have features for screen recording, location tracking, keystroke tracking, or webcam monitoring. We don't spy on our employees here at Toggl Track, and we think you shouldn't either.Read more about why we don't believe in surveillance here.",

        question: "It keeps taking me to a page where it says I’m signing up for a trial of Premium. I’d just like to sign up for a Free plan ?",
        answer: "Regardless of the plan, all new users get to try out our Premium features for free—for 30 days. You will not be asked to provide any billing information. When the 30 days are up, you’ll automatically lose access to the Premium features, but you can continue using Track on the Free plan."

        question: "If I sign up for a Free plan but add 6 users to my Workspace during my free Premium trial, what will happen to the 6th user once the 30 days are up?",
        answer: "All users will remain in the Workspace and all time tracking data will remain intact. However, once you’re back on the Free plan, the Workspace will be frozen and no one will be able to track time. To unfreeze the Workspace, reduce the number of active users to 5."

        id: 8, 
        question: "If I use your Premium features during the trial, what happens to all the data related to paid features (Tasks, Billable Rates, etc.) once my Workspace downgrades to the Free plan?",
        answer: "The data entered during the trial will be hidden, but not removed or deleted. If you upgrade to a paid plan sometime in the future, the data will become visible again. All the time entries will remain visible—only the associated data from paid features such as Tasks will be hidden."

        question: "If I have a paid Toggl Plan subscription, do I need to pay for Toggl Track?",
        answer: "Your Toggl Plan subscription will not influence your Toggl Track payment plan. You will need to sign up for a separate Toggl Track account even if you have a Toggl Plan account, and you will be billed separately according to the Toggl Track plan you’re on.If you have a paid Toggl Plan subscription, you can take advantage of the Toggl Plan and Track integration to track time within Plan"

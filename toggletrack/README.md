## Some Chanllenges We Faced :

-We have faced few challenges while working on project , sometimes it take lot of time to finish the tasks , but on the other hand we learned many things from that. some of the challenges are-
-As this is the first time we are working by creating branches from Github main , we have to handle the data carefully.
-Sometimes due to the some network issue there was a lack of communication between members but we able to sort out the issue and we finished our work within the given time.

## Conclusion & Experience :
-This is the project where we learnt about teamwork, we learned from other teammates and most impoertantly he value of taking timely decisions.
-We are very thankful to our Team lead,Teammates and instructor for helping us to finish the project within due date. We are looking forward to add some features and functionalities which we left in this project for future expansion.
-The entire journey of working with this project was great. We have learned lots of things by applying the ideas and concepts to the real website and we have got a lot of confidence.
-This project is the result of Hardwork and Dedication by the Team Members.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
